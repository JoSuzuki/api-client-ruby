## delete_member

Delete account member

Delete a single account member by ID. Requests to delete account members will not work if SCIM is enabled for the account.

### Examples

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'launchdarkly_api'
# setup authorization
LaunchDarklyApi.configure do |config|
  # Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
  config.api_key['ApiKey'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['ApiKey'] = 'Bearer'
end

api_instance = LaunchDarklyApi::AccountMembersApi.new
id = 'id_example' # String | The member ID

begin
  # Delete account member
  api_instance.delete_member(id)
rescue LaunchDarklyApi::ApiError => e
  puts "Error when calling AccountMembersApi->delete_member: #{e}"
end
```

#### Using the delete_member_with_http_info variant

This returns an Array which contains the response data (`nil` in this case), status code and headers.

## get_members

> <Members> get_members(opts)

List account members

Return a list of account members.  By default, this returns the first 20 members. Page through this list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links are not present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.  ### Filtering members  LaunchDarkly supports three fields for filters: `query`, `role`, and `lastSeen`:  - `query` is a string that matches against the members' emails and names. It is not case sensitive. - `role` is a `|` separated list of roles and custom roles. It filters the list to members who have any of the roles in the list. For the purposes of this filtering, `Owner` counts as `Admin`. - `lastSeen` is a JSON object in one of the following formats:   - `{\"never\": true}` - Members that have never been active, such as those who have not accepted their invitation to LaunchDarkly, or have not logged in after being provisioned via SCIM.   - `{\"noData\": true}` - Members that have not been active since LaunchDarkly began recording last seen timestamps.   - `{\"before\": 1608672063611}` - Members that have not been active since the provided value, which should be a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds.  For example, the filter `query:abc,role:admin|customrole` matches members with the string `abc` in their email or name, ignoring case, who also are either an an `Owner` or `Admin` or have the custom role `customrole`.  ### Sorting members  LaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting: `displayName` and `lastSeen`:  - `displayName` sorts by first + last name, using the member's email if no name is set. - `lastSeen` sorts by the `_lastSeen` property. LaunchDarkly considers members that have never been seen or have no data the oldest. 

### Examples

require 'time'

# setup authorization
LaunchDarklyApi.configure do |config|
  # Configure API key authorization: ApiKey

opts = {
  limit: 789, # Integer | The number of members to return in the response. Defaults to 20.
  offset: 789, # Integer | Where to start in the list. This is for use with pagination. For example, an offset of 10 would skip the first ten items and then return the next `limit` items.
  filter: 'filter_example', # String | A comma-separated list of filters. Each filter is of the form `field:value`. Supported fields are explained above.
  sort: 'sort_example' # String | A comma-separated list of fields to sort by. Fields prefixed by a dash ( - ) sort in descending order.
}

begin
  # List account members
  result = api_instance.get_members(opts)

## patch_member

> <Member> patch_member(id, patch_operation)

Modify an account member

 Update a single account member. The request should be a valid JSON Patch document describing the changes to be made to the member.  To update fields in the account member object that are arrays, set the `path` to the name of the field and then append `/<array index>`. Using `/0` appends to the beginning of the array. For example, to add a new custom role to a member, use the following request body:  ```   [     {       \"op\": \"add\",       \"path\": \"/customRoles/0\",       \"value\": \"some-role-id\"     }   ] ```  Requests to update account members will not work if SCIM is enabled for the account.

## post_members

> <Members> post_members(new_member_form)

Invite new members

> ### Full use of this API resource is only available to accounts with paid subscriptions > > The ability to bulk invite members is a paid feature. Single members may be invited if not on a paid plan.  Invite one or more new members to join an account. Each member is sent an invitation. Members with \"admin\" or \"owner\" roles may create new members, as well as anyone with a \"createMember\" permission for \"member/\\*\". If a member cannot be invited, the entire request is rejected and no members are invited from that request.  Each member _must_ have an `email` field and either a `role` or a `customRoles` field. If any of the fields are not populated correctly, the request is rejected with the reason specified in the \"message\" field of the response.  Requests to create account members will not work if SCIM is enabled for the account.  _No more than 50 members may be created per request._  A request may also fail because of conflicts with existing members. These conflicts are reported using the additional `code` and `invalid_emails` response fields with the following possible values for `code`:  - **email_already_exists_in_account**: A member with this email address already exists in this account. - **email_taken_in_different_account**: A member with this email address exists in another account. - **duplicate_email**s: This request contains two or more members with the same email address.  A request that fails for one of the above reasons returns an HTTP response code of 400 (Bad Request).

require 'time'
require 'launchdarkly_api'
